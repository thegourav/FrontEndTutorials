What i learned about event loop.

settimeout is not there in v8 its the webapi same like xhr

js means its own runtime

callstack process the js,webapi browser,eventloop,callback queue,qender queue.

if we exec lot of slow code to the cll stack then the rendering will be blocked as 60fps 16mil performance hit

we need to free the callstack then only event loop can pull item from callback q to callstack.
so rendering will be smooth.
